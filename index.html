    <h1>11/14 Prep - Animation</h1>
    <p>
    To achieve the style of animation that Dr. B achieved in class yesterday, it actually is not too complicated. The simple
    animations are done with a hover, the same hover we use within CSS. Luckily, modern browsers also support the newest rendition of
    CSS, CCS3, that has simple transitions baked into it. The simple transitions are a smooth transitions over an interval that you select.
    You can also go more in depth and create and change these transitions using JavaScript and D3. Instead of hover, you can use the 
    'mouseover' function to recreate a CSS hover.

    The code to create this within CSS would look something like this:
    </p>
    rect:hover {
    <p>
    <p>
    fill: orange;
    </p>
    <p>
    }
    </p>
    <p>
    rect {
    </p>
    <p>
    -moz-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    -o-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    -webkit-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    }
    </p>
